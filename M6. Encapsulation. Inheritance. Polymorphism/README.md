## Tasks  
**Objective:** *to understand the difference between overload and redefinition,modeling the relationship to can do using the ICloneable and IEquatable interfaces, using dependency injection in the method, correct use of inheritance, writing flexible extensible code, familiarity with the design pattern of the visitor.*
1. Perform refactoring (delegates do not use) the algorithm for sorting rows of a nonrectangular integer matrix (Task 2 of Topic 4), allowing to perform sorting, both in ascending and descending, depending on the matrix rows sent to the method of comparison (standard interfaces do not use). Develop unit-tests using the string comparison criteria listed in Develop unit-tests using the string comparison criteria listed in.
2. Develop a class hierarchy for describing geometric shapes - Circles, Triangles, Squares, Rectangles. Classes must describe the properties of a shape and have methods for calculating the area and perimeter of the shape. (A task with an emphasis on building an inheritance hierarchy, without unduly detailed implementation).
3. Create a Polinom (polynomial) class for working with polynomials of degree n> 0 from one variable of real type (as an internal structure for storing coefficients, use the sz-array). For the developed class, you need to override the necessary methods of the Object class and also overload operations that are acceptable for working with polynomials. Develop unit-tests.
