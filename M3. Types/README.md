## Tasks  
**Objective:** *Hiding of implementation; design pattern Strategy preview.*
  1. Implement an algorithm that allows you to calculate the root of the n-th power (n∈N) from the number (a∈R) by the Newton method with a given accuracy. Check the work of the method (compare the result with the value calculated using the .NET Framework class Math.Pow method).
  2. Implement the algorithm of "bubble" sorting of non rectangular integer array (sort methods of class System.Array not to use) so that there was an opportunity to order matrix rows: 
    - In the order of increasing (decreasing) sums of elements of rows of the matrix;
    - In order of increasing (decreasing) the maximum elements of rows of the matrix;
    - In order of increasing (decreasing) the minimum elements of rows of the matrix;
    - etc.
