## Tasks  
**Objective:** 
- *study to Array and String types;* 
- *study searching and sorting algorithms.*

1. Two integer signed numbers and two positions of bits i and j (i <j) are given. Implement an algorithm for inserting one number into another so that the second number occupies the position from bit j to bit i (bits are numbered from right to left).
2. Implement a recursive algorithm for searching the maximum element in unsorted array.
3. Given an array of integers. Find and return an index n for which the sum of the elements to the left of it is equal to the sum of the elements on the right. If such an index does not return null (or -1).
4. Two strings include only characters from 'a' to 'z', return a concatenated alphabetized string, excluding duplicate characters.
5. Create a calculator which evaluates expressions in Reverse Polish notation. For example, expression 5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 - (which is equivalent to 5 + ((1 + 2) * 4) - 3 in normal notation) should evaluate to 14. Note, that for simplicity you may assume that there are always spaces between numbers and operations, e.g. 1 3 + expression is valid, but 1 3+ isn't. Empty expression should evaluate to 0. Valid operations are +, -, *, /. You may assume that there won't be exceptional situations (like stack underflow or division by zero).
